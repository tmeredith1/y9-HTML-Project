  </div>
</div>

<h6 style="margin-top: -650px;">How are these two SDGs Related?</h6>
<p class="text2">SDG 6 and 14 are truely connected by water.<br> Both have a goal of protecting sources of water so<br> that they can be used sustainably for many years to<br> come. Although there are obvious differences in the<br> missions of each SDG the common goal of protecting<br> humanity as well as ecosystems is significant. Along<br> with this both SDGs work in symbiotic relationship.<br> If rivers and waters are contaminated by feces<br> from those without proper sanitation, it can give<br> animals deseases as well as humans upon re-ingestion<br> of the fish. Both of these SDGs are trying to<br> accomplish an important mission and it is our goal<br> to help incourage those around us to be our best<br> possible selves.</p>
<h6 class="right" style="margin-top: -320px">Why is it Important we Focus on These <br>Two Causes?</h6>
<p class="text-right" style="margin-top: -20px">Both SDG 6 and 14 are extremely significant causes<br> that can benefit our world in a number of ways.<br> Firstly, both benefit impoveriged nations. SDG 6 is <br>benefical as it supplies people with a lack<br> of clean drinking water with a clean source as well as<br> proper toilets, and soap. SDG 14 helps impovereged <br>nations by supplying them with jobs working on <br>boats or docks which many people have not<br> been able to maintain due to illegal<br> fisherman stealing catch. Illegal vessels stealing<br> catch has been a large problem and SDG 6 will work <br>to rectify that. Along with this, both SDGs benfit the <br>oceans as SDG 6 will reduce the amount of water contaminated by <br>humans and SDG 14 will improve the seas by increasing<br> animal life and biodiversity.</p>
<h6 style="margin-top: -5px;">What can you do the Benefit Both<br>SDGs?</h3>
<p class="text2">There are a number of ways you can support both<br> SDG 6 and 14. Firstly, donating to charities that<br> support the protection of oceans or clean drinking<br> water and sanitation. Although it may seem like you<br> are not really doing much, a small donation can go a<br> long way. Although there may not be as many ways<br> to actively impact SDG 6 there are certainly ways to<br> impact SDG 14. Firstly, try and buy fewer single use <br> plastics as they have little value and tend to end up in<br> oceans. If you see any plastics on the streets, try and<br> pick them up so they do not end up in a lake, river or<br> ocean. Although this seems small every bag off the<br> street could save the life of an marine animal.</p>  
<h6 class="right" style="margin-top: -300px;">What is so Significant About the Ocean?</h6>
<p class="text-right">Oceans are truely one of earth's greatest marvels.<br> No other planet in our solar system contains the beautiful<br> life bringing substance of water. It is extremely important<br> that we keep our oceans, lakes and rivers safe.<br> Oceans supply us with nearly 50 percent of our oxygen,<br> ensuring that our atmposphere stays supplied with<br> clean and breathable air. Along with this the ocean<br> supplies us with a great deal of our food. Truely,<br> the ocean is a lifeline for earth and for humanity and<br> it is our duty to keep it protected as<br> once it is gone it will never come back .</p>
